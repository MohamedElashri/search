<br/>

A super lightweight search engine router that allows users to search across websites from a single interface with quality of life additions.

## Features:

1. **Lightweight** - The project is extremely quick to load and run. It uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Custom Defaults** - Users can select the search engine they'd like to use by default via a convenient dropdown menu.
3. **Bang Patterns** - Users can add special commands (eg, "!g" for Google, "!yt" for YouTube) to their query to quickly switch to a specific search engine or website.
4. **Snap Patterns** - Users can use the same special commands as bangs, substituting '!' for '@', to do a search in their chosen engine that is filtered to a specific site. For example, searching for only GitHub results on DuckDuckGo. 

The full list of bang/snap patterns is available on the site.
